# ðŸŒ± Smart Irrigation System using Machine Learning

This project presents an intelligent irrigation system that uses machine learning techniques to recommend optimal irrigation decisions based on environmental conditions. The system is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Irrigation_System.ipynb`) and aims to help farmers or researchers optimize water usage in agriculture.
